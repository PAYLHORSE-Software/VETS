## ABOUT

Current translation solutions for Japanese games are too messy for general use. VETS hopes to be a full-featured, unintrusive, utilitarian solution for tackling that text-heavy imported JRPG or VN with confidence.

VETS uses the Google Cloud Vision API to spot text, ![KAKASI](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en) for romaji conversion, and DeepL machine translation.

## FEATURES

- **Unintrusive:** No overlays, drag-to-capture shenanigans or multi-window setups. Fix VETS to an area of your screen, and update translation with a keypress. Translation is organized into an ordered list of 'packets', one for each block of text.
- **Universal:** VETS works through screen capture: if it's visible on your screen, then VETS can read it for you.
- **Romaji Processing:** Optional phonetic transcription, for those learning to read!
- **Cutting-Edge OCR and Translation:** The gcloud and DeepL set up might be a little involved, but the end result really is the best of the best screen reading.
