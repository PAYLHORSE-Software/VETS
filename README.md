<strong>A utilitarian translation tool for Japanese games.</strong>
</p>

## ABOUT
Current translation solutions for Japanese games require a setup far too involved for general use. VETS hopes to be a full-featured, unintrusive, plug-and-play solution for tackling that text-heavy imported JRPG or VN with confidence.

VETS uses the excellent ![manga-ocr](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr) library to spot text, ![KAKASI](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en) for romaji conversion, and DeepL machine translation.

## FEATURES

## INSTALLATION

Assuming you have **Python** and **pip** installed on your system, VETS has a single additional dependency:

```bash
pip3 install manga-ocr
```
