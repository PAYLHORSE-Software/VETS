<strong>A utilitarian screen translation tool for Japanese games.</strong>

## ABOUT

Current translation solutions for Japanese games are too messy for general use. VETS hopes to be a full-featured, unintrusive, utilitarian solution for tackling that text-heavy imported JRPG or VN with confidence.

VETS uses the Google Cloud Vision API to spot text, ![KAKASI](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en) for romaji conversion, and DeepL machine translation.

## FEATURES

- **Cutting-Edge OCR and Translation:** The gcloud and DeepL set up might be a little involved, but the end result really is the best of the best screen translation: take our word for it.
