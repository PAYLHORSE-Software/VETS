<strong>A utilitarian translation tool for Japanese games.</strong>
</p>

## ABOUT
Current translation solutions for Japanese games require a setup far too involved for general use. VETS hopes to be a full-featured, unintrusive, plug-and-play solution for tackling that text-heavy imported JRPG or VN with confidence.

VETS uses ![tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to spot text, ![KAKASI](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en) for romaji conversion, and DeepL machine translation.

## FEATURES

## USAGE

VETS has a single requirement, that being having **tesseract** installed on your system. See: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
